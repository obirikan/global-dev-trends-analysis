# Stack Overflow Developer Trends Analysis

This project explores global developer trends using Stack Overflow survey data (2018–2020). The analysis focuses on handling missing data, understanding developer demographics, and uncovering insights relevant to tech hiring and workforce planning.

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess survey data with missing values
- Analyze developer roles, employment, and education by country
- Investigate the relationship between experience and compensation
- Visualize key findings to inform hiring strategies

## Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing data (deletion, imputation, NOCB, multiple imputation)
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Pandas for data manipulation

## Conclusion
This analysis of Stack Overflow survey data reveals key trends in the global developer community. Most developers are employed full-time and specialize in front-end, back-end, or full-stack roles. Computer Science remains the most common educational background, but other majors are also entering the field. There is a clear relationship between years of experience and compensation, with more experienced developers earning higher salaries on average. By carefully handling missing data, the analysis provides reliable insights that can help guide hiring and workforce planning decisions.
